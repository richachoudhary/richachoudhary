# 👋 Hi, I'm Richa Choudhary

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with ~7 years of experience building and scaling ML systems across NLP, Computer Vision, and traditional time-series domains. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems using data, models, and elegant engineering and I'm especially drawn to areas at the intersection of **research and product**.

Currently **following interesting research** from OpenAI, Meta AI, FAIR, and DeepMind, with a focus on contributing to next-generation models, applied ML, and responsible AI systems.

## 🔬 Current Focus

- ⚙️ Efficient deep learning architectures (Transformers, MobileNets, Distilled Models)
- 📚 NLP: Text summarization, Q&A systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- 👁️‍🗨️ Vision: Visual Question Answering (VQA), self-supervised learning in CV
- 🧠 ML for personalization, recsys, and user behavior modeling

## 📂 Projects

### 👁️ CV Projects

- [`object-detection-iOS-app`](https://github.com/richachoudhary/object-detection-ios-app)
  A real-time object detection application for iOS devices that utilizes computer vision to identify and classify objects through the device's camera.


- [`efficient-cv-models`]()  
  Implemented and benchmarked light-weight models like MobileNetV3, SqueezeNet, and EfficientNet-lite on edge devices.  

### 🧠 NLP Projects

- [`transformer-from-scratch`](https://github.com/richachoudhary/MLCoding/blob/main/NLP_GENAI/transformer.py)
  A minimal yet complete implementation of the Transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017). Includes positional encoding, multi-head attention, and masking for decoder logic.  


- [`abstractive-summarizer`](https://github.com/yourusername/abstractive-summarizer)  
  Built using Hugging Face + Seq2Seq models (T5, BART). Added evaluation metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, and support for custom datasets.
